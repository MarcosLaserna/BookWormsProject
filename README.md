<H1> COP3530 - BookWormsProject </h1>

This repository contains 2 folders, 3 code files and this README.md. The folder dataset contains books and user rating per book data. It will be used in graph.py and hashmap.py files, which contains the code of both algorithms. The frontend folder contains the generated project files by vite when using react for a frontend along with its dependencies. Within this though there is a src folder containing the app.jsx, main.jsx, and components folder. App.jsx routes the different pages of the application and within components ther is the Footer.jsx, PreferencesForm.jsx, and Recommendations.jsx files that contain the majority of frontend code.

To run the project you will first need to be sure that you have all the proper dependecies installed for python that are detailed in the pdf. Then, download the entire project then open it in whatever software and then change directory to BookWormsProject and run `python app.py` then once the flask backend runs change directory from BookWormsProject to frontend and run `npm run dev` then the app should open with a local link in the console and you can use that to use the application!!
